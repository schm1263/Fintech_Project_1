Analysis Summary
</h2>
<p>
When comparing the money supply over the past 40 years to the major asset classes, like stocks, bonds, housing prices, it does appear that the money supply correlates to the value of these assests. For example, in the below line graph the data shows that the 3 major stock indices (SP500, DOW, and NASDAQ) follow the same upwards trend as the money supply and increases at the same rate (slope of the lines). Given that the some of the values are significantly different, we decided to calcualte the z-score of each data set in order to normalize the values and compare. When doing this in a line graph we see the same visual trend and correlation as previously described but with normalized magnitudes. Creating a correlation table and heat map for the 40 year comparison data frame supports the observations from the line graph. All of the stock indices are closely correlated to the money supply with the NASDAQ having the loosest correlation at 0.94.

The economic indicators of GDP and Personal Income show a strong correlation over the last 40 years.  Even the new asset class of crypto currences, like Bitcoin, seem to be extremely correlated.

<p>This raises a question whether there could be another factor raising all values of our measurements.  It's important to understand that the Pearson Correlation measures the strength of the ability of two measures to move together at the same rate. To reduce the noise we chose to do a 3 year rolling Z-Score measurement and see what the effects could be.
</p>
<p>
When the Money Supply (M2) Z-Score is compared to the asset classes over a rolling three year period there is a lot less correlation between Money Supply and the other specified asset.  However, with some assets like real estate, there appears to be a possible delayed correlation between an increase in Money Supply and Housing Prices.
