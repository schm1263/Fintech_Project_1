Analysis Summary
</h2>
<p>
When comparing the money supply over the past 40 years to the major stock indices it does appear that the money supply correlates to the value of the stock market. A line graph of the data shows that the 3 major stock indices (SP500, DOW, and NASDAQ) follow the same upwards trend as the money supply and increases at the same rate (slope of the lines). Given that the some of the values are significantly different, we decided to calcualte a rolling 3 year z-score of each data set in order to normalize the values and compare. When doing this in a line graph we see the same visual trend and correlation as previously described but with normalized magnitudes. Creating a correlation table and heat map for the 40 year comparison data frame supports the observations from the line graph. All of the stock indices are closely correlated to the money supply with the NASDAQ having the loosest correlation at 0.94.

<h2>Rollling Z-Score: M2 Compared to Housing Prices</h2>
<p>During the time frame analyzed (January 1997 to May 2021) the money supple grew at a higher rate than house prices as indicated on the slopes of the curves at the national level.</p>
